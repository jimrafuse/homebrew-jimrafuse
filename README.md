# README

I would advise you to not use this tap. See below.

- ghostscript-jimrafuse: depends on fontconfig
- imagemagick@6-jimrafuse: depends on fontconfig, ghostscript-jimrafuse, and **linked into home**
- ruby-jimrafuse: **linked into home**
- xpdf-jimrafuse: installs the tools only (`pdfimages`, `pdfinfo`, etc)
